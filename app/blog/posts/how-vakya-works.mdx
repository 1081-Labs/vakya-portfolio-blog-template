When you create a new blog with Vakya, it automatically sets up a Next.js blog structure in your chosen directory. You can also:

- Customize the Next.js app as needed
- Set up a remote repository on GitHub 
- Host your project on your choice of platform (like Vercel, Firebase, etc)
- When you write new posts and push it to your GitHub repository, it'll deploy on your hosting platform.

Vakya will soon make all this work easy for you in the future versions.

If you do end up doing any updates on the Next.js app, make sure any new packages are installed and build succeeds:
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Feel free to explore the blog set up via Next.js and make it your own!
