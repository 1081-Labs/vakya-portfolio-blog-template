When you create a new blog with Vakya, it automatically sets up a Next.js blog structure in your chosen directory. You can also:

- Customize the Next.js app as needed
- Set up a remote repository on GitHub

If you do end up doing any updates on the Next.js app, make sure any new packages are installed and build succeeds:
```
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Feel free to explore the blog set up via Next.js and make it your own!
